# Synthetic Flower Bloom Classifier
This is a machine learning project that trains an AI how to distinguish a flower bud and a flower bloom state.
These flower images are randomly generated by a 8x8 grayscale matrix.

# Classification
The classifier denotes a label on a given image using logistic regression. The AI is trained to recognize the difference between either a
Bud: A compact flower; a centered white square
Bloom: A larger, yet hollow flower; a large centered white square with a smaller dark square in the middle

# Requirements
```Bash
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
```
Note: You may also run this project on Google Colab through the .ipynb file in this repository, in which case, no bash scripting is required.

# Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

# Step-By-Step Explanation
1. Generates an 8x8 matrix of flower buds and blooms
2. Gaussian noise is added to the matrices to create varying tints on models
3. 200 bud and 200 bloom images are generated with random noise, with 80% of data used for training the logistic regression model, while the remaining 20% is used for evaluating the accuracy of the AI model
4. Labels are output with an accuracy score attached to the result

# Additional Information
1. I originally developed this program for Wat.AI, and the legacy version from September 18th, 2025 can still be accessed today in [here](https://github.com/r1thm/ai-skill-showcase-fork/commit/c0af9296adc2f9ab46d407cd91af62e38e39ac09). This is a reupload of my legacy project on a branch onto my own repository.
